00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.160
a few more yeah what's the most important thing that you

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.160
personally learned at apple that you're doing it next

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.240
good question um

4
00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.440
i'm not sure i learned this when i was at apple but i learned it

5
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.680
based on the data when i was at apple

6
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.239
and that is

7
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.039
i now take a longer term view on people in other words when i see something not

8
00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.640
being done right my first reaction isn't to go fix it

9
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.480
um it's to say

10
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.480
we're building a team here and we're going to do great stuff for the next

11
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.240
decade not just the next year and so

12
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.960
what do i need to do to help so that the person that's screwing up

13
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.119
learns versus how do i fix the problem

14
00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.520
and uh that's painful sometimes and my and i

15
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.360
still have that first instinct to go fix the problem but

16
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.200
that's taking a longer term view on people is probably the biggest thing

17
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.840
that's changed and then i don't know that's you know maybe the part that's

18
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.840
biological but

19
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.720
yes
